# generator-newsapp [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cirlabs/generator-newsapp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cirlabs/generator-newsapp)

Scaffold news applications like a boss. generator-newsapp highlights include:

- Drop-in integration with our [Django Project Template](https://github.com/cirlabs/django-project-template) for blazing fast and awesome development (__recommended__)
- Built-in server and Grunt tasks for standalone development without Django
- Sass (optional)
- Preconfiguration for Amazon S3 deployment

## Requirements
- [Node.js 0.12.x](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js 1.2.x](https://iojs.org/en/index.html)
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). Install with `npm install -g yo`

## Templates
__generator-newsapp__ includes two types of templates: `Django Project Template` and `Front-end Web App Template`.

`Django Project Template` is meant to work in tandem with our actual [Django Project Template](https://github.com/cirlabs/django-project-template). Use this template when you want the convenience Grunt and Bower with the power of Django and Python web development.

`Front-end Web App Template` is similar to the Yeoman team's [generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) and is meant to be a generator for a web application. Use this template if you're not relying on Django for data manipulation and what to do everything client side.

## Setup
```bash
$ npm install -g generator-newsapp
$ mkdir awesome-newsapp && cd $_
$ yo newsapp # follow prompts
$ mv credentials.template credentials.json
$ grunt serve
```
